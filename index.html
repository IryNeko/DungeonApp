Northeastern University, Web development class.

the purpose of this website
mini dungeon story generator
I am trying to build a small tool for some online table games.
WHY DO I WANT THIS
now with Zoom and other software it becomes feasible for people to play table games like D&D on video conference. The trouble part of the table games is that people has to have some sort of stage. There are others programs out there but I want to try make my own. Of course it is going to be a crude prototype.
It may also be considered as a game as it has minor intractability
