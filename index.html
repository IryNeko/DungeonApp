Northeastern University, Web development class.

the purpose of this website
mini dungeon story generator
I am trying to build a small tool for some online table games.
WHY DO I WANT THIS
now with Zoom and other software it becomes feasible for people to play table games like D&D on video conference. The trouble part of the table games is that people has to have some sort of stage. There are others programs out there but I want to try make my own. Of course it is going to be a crude prototype.
It may also be considered as a game as it has minor intractability

This tool is under development for about 6 weeks and will be updated<br>
<h2>Function of this Tool</h2>
this tool is developed for Discord and Zoom video session of tabletop games. the main purpose is to optimize the experience<br>
dungeon page allows DM to start a story<br>
<h3>DM map editor</h3>
Map Editor allows customization of game maps, please first create a new map<br>
then you can use a list of 20 numbers to edit specific lines<br>
Be sure to save the map or export the map to clipboard to avoid data loss<br>
<h3>DM character editor</h3>
Currently under development, the character page allows the user to create a new character with character ID<br>
please be sure to use an ID, or the character will not be saved<br>
avoid repeat ID to avoid data overwrite<br>

<h2>Why did I write this</h2>
<h3>Class Project</h3>
Web Application Development class<br>
<h3>A more "busy" dungeon tool</h3>
Currently similar software exists, but they are too complicated with functions<br>
Tools 
while lacking fundamental fun of making story with friends.
